# Monster Twitch

### Transform your Twitch.TV experience

Slims down chat, removes the Left bar, maximizes the video space.

Removes the channel header, the info section and gives you more space with the 'Monster' button to the right of the volume rocker (on the flash player itself).

Big Ass Mode. Hide the chat, press the button, and watch your big ass stream. Doesn't matter what size your browser tab is. My goal is a fluid experience, please let me know about any bugs.

Blue Clear Mode Additionally helps clear formatting, if white mode isn't working click the toggle again to get blue mode. Keep toggling to clear through back to your desired mode.
